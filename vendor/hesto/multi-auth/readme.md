# Hesto MultiAuth for Laravel 5.3

- `php artisan multi-auth:install {guard} -f`

## What it does?
With one simple command you can setup multi auth for your Laravel 5.3 project. The package installs:
- Model
- Migration
- Controllers
- Notification
- Routes
  - routes/web.php
    - {guard}/login
    - {guard}/register
    - {guard}/logout
    - password reset routes
  - routes/{guard}.php
    - {guard}/home
- Middleware
- Views
- Guard
- Provider
- Password Broker
- Settings 

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Through Composer

```
composer require hesto/multi-auth
```

### Step 2: Add the Service Provider

You'll only want to use these package for local development, so you don't want to update the production `providers` array in `config/app.php`. Instead, add the provider in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, like so:

```php
public function register()
{
	if ($this->app->environment() == 'local') {
		$this->app->register('Hesto\MultiAuth\MultiAuthServiceProvider');
	}
}
```

### Step 3: Install Multi-Auth files in your project

```
php artisan multi-auth:install {singular_lowercase_name_of_guard} -f

//examples
php artisan multi-auth:install admin -f
php artisan multi-auth:install employee -f
php artisan multi-auth:install customer -f
```

Notice:
If you don't provide `-f` flag, it will not work. It is a protection against accidental activation.

### Step 4: Migrate new model table 

```
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 5: Try it

Go to: `http://url_to_your_proejct/guard/login`
Example: `http://project/admin/login`

### Step 4: Options

If you don't want model and migration use `--model` flag.
```
php artisan multi-auth:install admin -f --model
```

If you don't want views use `--views` flag.
```
php artisan multi-auth:install admin -f --views
```

If you don't want routes in your `routes/web.php` file, use `--routes` flag.

```
php artisan multi-auth:install admin -f --routes
```
